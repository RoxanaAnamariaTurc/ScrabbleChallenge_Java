## Scrabble Challenge Java

### Project Objectives

This project's aim is to test the understanding of java fundamentals by creating a scrabble game.


### Technologies Used

Java

### Project Approach

* Created a Scrabble class
* Instantiated 2 fields one for score and one for the word and created a hashmap to be able to insert the key value pairs for the letters and corresponding scores
* Created a constructor for the class where I populated the hashmap
* Created a score() method where checked if the word is null or an empty string and if so would return the score 0 and if the word is an actual string would first 
use the java function toUpperCase() to have all the letters forming the word in upper case and then calculated the score by iterating through the word with the help
of a for loop and adding each value for the letter into the variable score and then returning the total

### Getting Started

Fork and clone this project to your local machine
Run all the tests from the tests folder
Create a new object of type Scrabble and give it a String on constructor and print this in the main class to see the results

### Project Review

This project was a great start point to learn more java basics and to use the OOP approach to creating classes and objects in Java

### Potential Next Steps for the Project

This project can be improved further by implementing more complex rules to calculate scores for the words
